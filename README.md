# üì∏ Digital Image Processing Lab
This repository contains MATLAB codes, scripts, and resources for all Digital Image Processing (DIP) labs conducted during the course, guided by **[Dr. Tapan Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-tapan-jain-18731717/?originalSubdomain=in)**.

## üß™ Introduction

Welcome to the **Digital Image Processing (DIP) Lab** repository. This lab focuses on understanding and implementing various fundamental and advanced concepts of image processing using tools like MATLAB and Python.

Throughout the lab sessions, we will explore **multiple experiments**, each targeting different image processing techniques such as filtering, transformation, and enhancement. These experiments provide a practical approach to learn and apply concepts in real-world scenarios.
